/*
In previous programs, you asked the user for repeated input by writing the input statements multiple times. But itâ€™s more efficient to use loops to deal with repeated input.

Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and computes the total of the numbers.

Example Output
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
The total is 15.
Constraints
The prompting must use repetition, such as a counted loop, not three separate prompts.
Create a flowchart before writing the program.
